Model Artificial Anasazi (JASSS) (ver. 3.2)

Frederik Schaff, Ruhr-Unviersity Bochum
frederik.schaff@rub.de
This version: April 2019 (first GIT version)
Note: This version needs LSD in GIS-beta-5 or later.

Version history
1.1: First implementation
2.0: Transfer to new template
3.0: Simplifying, new GIS usage.
3.1: Adjust further to new GIS (not complete - lattice still old)
3.2: Cleaning, first GIT version
3.21: Minor issues
 - Added Assumption_coordination
3.22: Update to GIS-beta-5


This model is a reimplementation of

	Janssen, Marco A. (2009): Understanding Artificial Anasazi. 
	In: JASS 12 (4), S. 13. Online verfügbar unter 
	http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/12/4/13.html.


	The code of the original model is available at:
	https://www.openabm.org/model/2222/version/2/view 
		(note: Version 1 and 2 differ only in line 648, related to the 
		model view not the code, and the netlogo version number changed 
		from 5.0.1 to 5.3.1. The bug reported in Stonedahl/Wilensky was 
		not fixed, but irrelevant anyway)


which is based on (itself a reimplementation of):

	Dean, Jeffrey; Gumerman, George; Epstein, Joshua; Axtell, Robert; 
	Swedlund, Alan; Parker, Miles; McCarroll, Steven (2000): 
	Understanding Anasazi Culture Change Through Agent-Based Modeling. 
	Chapter 7. In: Timothy Kohler und George Gumerman (Hg.): Dynamics in 
	Human and Primate Societies. Agent-Based Modeling of Social and Spacial 
	Processes: Oxford University Press, S. 179205.

And, for a discussion of the implementation by Janssen and the exposition of 
a minor bug (that had no effect), as well as a modified reimplementation:

	Stonedahl, Forrest; Wilensky, Uri (2010): Evolutionary Robustness Checking 
	in the Artificial Anasazi Model. Complex Adaptive Systems Resilience, 
	Robustness, and Evolvability: Papers from the AAAI Fall Symposium 
	(FS-10-03).

The model is validated and produces, at least from a visual inspection, also the same dynamics as the original one. In addition, several implicit assumptions are tracked and tested. Basically, it shows that the model is "fitted" to follow the capacity of the land, if intended or not.
